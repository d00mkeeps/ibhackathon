# ESG/Financial Analysis Tool

Thanks for showing interest in my ESG/financial analysis machine! It's designed to assist investment panels in making rapid data-driven decisions. (Still needs a good name - open to suggestions!)

## Live Demo

You can access the tool **[here](https://miles-ibcapital.up.railway.app/)**

## About the Code

This is the complete source code. You can explore:

- Prompt engineering: `backend/app/services/chains/investment_analysis_chain.py`
- System prompts: `backend/app/services/llm/prompt.py`
- Full architecture and implementation

The Tuesday dataset has been sent separately via email - you can use it to verify the AI's responses against factual data.

## How to Use

1. Start typing in the text box to search for companies we have data for
2. Select a company (or use one of the three quick-select options)
3. When the chat interface appears, send a message or use quick-select options
4. Wait ~10s for responses (don't send multiple messages while loading!)
5. Continue the conversation as needed
6. **Refresh the page when finished** (conversations aren't saved)

## Notes

- All data is completely private
- Built-in search function provides external market data (experimental - try asking the bot about external search vs Tuesday Dataset capabilities)
- Please keep this codebase within the core Islandbridge team only

_This project represents thousands of hours of learning and development. I really value the intellectual property and hard work that went into building this AI system._

**Thanks,**
